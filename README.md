# Lunch planner

Everyday computer scientists throughout the world much solve the famous Lunch 
Problem, i.e. choosing a lunch plan. One approach would be to simply choose 
entirely at random. However, people tend to have preferences and they want to 
coordinate their lunch plans to some extent.

Thus we need a distributed protocol which chooses a lunch plan depending on each 
participant's preferences for the options.
